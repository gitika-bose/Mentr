## Summary

SaaS Product Features 
* Welcome page with "sign up" and "sign in" visible to public
* The SaaS product contains a sign up and sign in page, allowing mentors and mentees to make an account. 
* SaaS product sign up ensures that users are unique
* Each mentor/mentee has a profile with their personal information (eg. username) viewable only to themselves. 
* Users can edit their username, email, or password as needed 
* Users can delete their accounts 

The above user login functionality is vital for the mentor profiles we intend to create along with the interaction between mentors and mentees!
